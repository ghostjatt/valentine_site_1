Eyes speak a world when your heart beats in love. The first step to flirt is looking into his/her eyes. Let your eyes do the talking. This will not only make him/her notice you but who knows, the person might even come up to you and start talking.<br><br><br>&ndash;   Invite him to dance: Nothing can be more seductive and flirtatious than having a close dance with the one you like. Be your romantic best, make sensuous moves, dance close to his/her body and keep up that radiant smile. He will go head over heels for you and will not be able to keep his/her eyes off you.<br><br><br>&ndash;   Be bold: The best way to impress a person is by being bold. Come straight when you want to say something. Touch him/her if you want to and say him/her so.<br><br><br>&ndash;   Occasional complements: Most women and even men love to be flattered. Praise her skin, appreciate his attitude, flatter your partner with best romantic comments. However, make sure you do not overdo it.<br><br><br>&ndash;   Seal a kiss: Nothing can be more arousing than a passionate kiss. Place a kiss on his/her lips while parting, or just go up to the person and give him/her a strong smooch and that can work wonders for the both of you.<br><br><br>&ndash;   Share a drink: When all your want is romance, why not share a drink. Order a single drink and sip alternatively into the delicious liquid. This will not only add to the fun of sharing but also evoke passion for both of you.<br><br><br>&ndash;   Initiate Conversation: When he/she comes up to you and takes the seat across you, and just looks at you, be the one to start the conversation. Invite him/her to participate in the talk and try to understand him/her when he speaks. Ask him about his interests and passions and let him know yours. However, make sure not to ask personal questions on the first meet.<br><br><br>&ndash;   Flaunt yourself: Everyone is special in some way or the other. You might have great eyes, or seducing lips, angelic looks, or silky hair…the best way to flirt is to flaunt your looks. Roll a silky hair strand in your fingers invitingly, roll your eyes, smile often and move sensuality to make him go crazy.<br><br><br>&ndash;   Text messages: Once you manage to get his /her phone number, make it a point to keep in touch. Keep flirting with romantic flirt text messages and do it in equal intervals. Just do not let your thoughts get out of his/her mind.<br><br><br>&ndash;   Touch to flirt: Nothing can make the other person excited like your touch. You do not have to search for reasons to touch him/her. Small gentle touches like holding hands while crossing the road, touching her cheeks as a loving gesture, touching his neck playfully and more can do wonders for your relationship.<br><br>&ndash;   Top 10 flirting tips will pave your way to that person’s heart who has never failed to attract your attention, wherever you might be.<br></em> Valentine&rsquo;s Day Love Horoscope 2013<br>&ndash;   Aries Love Horoscope<br>Year 2013 is going to be an exciting year in terms of love and relationship matters with planets- Uranus and Jupiter forecasted to position in favor of Arieans.
